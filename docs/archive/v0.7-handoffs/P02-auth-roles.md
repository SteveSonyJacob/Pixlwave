> HISTORICAL v0.7 HANDOFF - superseded by the seven-phase v0.8 plan. Do not implement from this file or treat its phase/test IDs as current.

# P02 handoff - Authentication and role permissions

Plan version: 0.7 draft. Updated: 2026-09-15.  
Status: NOT STARTED  
Implementation revision: NOT AVAILABLE  
Application tests: NOT RUN  
Manual acceptance: NOT REVIEWED

## Context and current authority

Read [the plan](../../../plan.md), [handoff guide](../../../handoff.md) and [decision register](../../decisions.md). This v0.7 specification replaces earlier workflow assumptions; previous tests were never run. Review [blueprint coverage and resolved answers](../../requirements-review.md) and plan sections 3.6-3.8 before implementing checkout, media or money records.

Requirements: R02, R03, R09.  
Dependencies: P01.  
Decision gates: D09 auth modes/providers; D14 owner verification fields.

Previous phase: [P01 - Engineering foundation](P01-foundation.md).

Current workflow: one upfront cart payment; admin coordinates/decides within seven days of payment; paid-pending items reserve nothing; admin approval alone reserves. Undecided requests automatically reject at day seven and create refund tasks. Admin performs every refund manually and marks it refunded only after completion; no automatic money movement. Advertiser cancellation within seven days refunds 95% of the cancelled booking amount; Pixlwave retains 5% inclusive of Razorpay processing charges, with no additional processing deduction or fulfillment commission. Later business refunds are limited to owner inability/non-delivery. Owner initial base price and admin-only published-price revisions replace automatic pricing. No pause/change flows or fixed completion countdown. Admin transfers owner funds manually after verification; completed service pays 85% to the owner and Razorpay charges come out of Pixlwave's 15%. Owners specify ad duration, plays per show/day and operating hours for admin approval. Notice is exactly 192 hours from successful payment; review/cancellation closes at 168 hours. Rejection/owner-failure refunds deduct only actual applicable Razorpay processing charges, with no penalty. Admin determines partial-delivery refund amounts manually.

## Entry checklist

- [ ] Repository/local instructions and current accepted decisions read.
- [ ] Prior-phase actual evidence and required inputs verified.
- [ ] Relevant unanswered parameters resolved; accepted policies are not reopened.
- [ ] Provider/configuration prerequisites recorded without secrets.
- [ ] Planned review fixtures, environment and implementation scope agreed.

## Planned deliverables

- [ ] Implement Supabase authentication, phone OTP and selected email method, recovery, session expiry, verified identifier linking and business/profile details.
- [ ] Allow one individual account to use advertiser and owner modes; separately grant platform administrator privileges.
- [ ] Build owner verification and admin review with server-side checks, database policies, rate limits and privileged audit logs.
- [ ] Explicitly forbid owner accounts from receiving customer request queues or accepting/rejecting bookings. Only admins perform booking decisions and subsequent published-price changes.
- [ ] Protect admin accounts with appropriate MFA and least-privilege access as an engineering requirement.

## Planned testing and validation

- [ ] P02-T01: Exercise login, expired/reused OTP, recovery, logout, session expiry and duplicate/linked identities.
- [ ] P02-T02: Try direct API/database cross-user reads, role escalation and owner attempts to approve/reject requests or change a published rate.
- [ ] P02-T03: Confirm role switching grants no admin privileges and unverified owners cannot publish listings.
- [ ] P02-T04: Validate real auth-delivery setup in allowed test accounts; distinguish provider-blocked checks from mock passes.

Manual acceptance scenario: Review advertiser/owner switching, verification and restricted owner/admin actions with separate accounts.

Exit gate: Authentication and permissions are enforced on server/database as well as UI.

## Validation evidence

These are unexecuted checks, not completed results.

| Check | Revision/environment | Command or manual steps | Expected | Observed | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P02-T01 | Not available | Define exact reproduction | As specified above | Not executed | None | NOT RUN |
| P02-T02 | Not available | Define exact reproduction | As specified above | Not executed | None | NOT RUN |
| P02-T03 | Not available | Define exact reproduction | As specified above | Not executed | None | NOT RUN |
| P02-T04 | Not available | Define exact reproduction | As specified above | Not executed | None | NOT RUN |
| Manual review | Not available | Follow acceptance scenario | Client accepts behaviour | Not reviewed | None | NOT REVIEWED |

Record execution date/time, fixture, role, browser/device and report/trace/screenshot path. Keep blocked or failing checks visible. A simulated funded fixture does not prove gateway integration.

## Manual sign-off

- Reviewer/date: NOT ASSIGNED / NOT REVIEWED.
- Revision/environment: NOT AVAILABLE.
- Feedback: NOT RECORDED.
- Decision: NOT APPROVED.
- Required follow-up: NOT RECORDED.

## Issues and operations

| Item | Impact | Owner | Required action | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Remaining phase gates | See decision gates above | Client for policy; developer for verification | Resolve accepted parameter/provider requirements | OPEN |
| No implementation | Phase features not delivered | Future developer | Complete scope and validation | NOT STARTED |

During implementation, record defects with severity, reproduction, affected requirements and next-phase impact. Add setup/configuration, migration recovery, alerts, expiry jobs and manual refund queues, retries, money reconciliation, provider escalation, retention and costs as applicable. Current operational state: NOT IMPLEMENTED.

## Next-phase handoff

Next: [P03 - Inventory, owner base prices, and media](P03-inventory-media.md). Deliver the schema/contracts, configuration references, fixtures and evidence it needs.

Before transfer:
- [ ] Delivered scope and actual revision documented.
- [ ] Required checks passed with evidence; exceptions explicitly recorded.
- [ ] User/client manual review recorded.
- [ ] Accepted decisions reflected in the plan and register.
- [ ] Recovery/operations and next actions are reproducible.

## Change history

| Date | Revision | Change |

| 2026-09-14 | Initial draft | Created phase template; no implementation/tests. |
| 2026-09-14 | 0.4 | Rewrote planned scope/checks for latest admin-managed workflow and follow-up answers. Prior workflow specifications superseded; actual implementation remains absent. |
